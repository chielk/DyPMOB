		The task at hand is one of communication over a single channel.
		Multiple agents broadcast messages, but only one message can be sent at
		any time, otherwise conflicts will arise and no message will come
		through. After a message is sent, the agents will know whether a message
		was sent, a conflict has arisen, or no message was sent.
		Agents have a single buffer that may contain a message. At any concrete
		time-step an agent $i$ with an empty buffer may get a new message with
		probability $p_i(m)$.
		One of the goals is to optimise the total throughput of all the agents.
		This problem has been solved for POMDPs \cite{ooi1996decentralized}, but in this case we would
		also like to avoid dominance of a single agent over the channel.
		By representing the reward as a vector, we can calculate the optimal
		policy $\pi$, for any weight vector $\vec{w}$ if we know the reward
		vector $\vec{r}$.

		There are several several ways to represent throughput and dominance in a
		vector. One would be to have a two-dimensional vector that contains the
		total throughput and some measure of dominance, for instance entropy or
		variance.
		Another way is to represent the vector as an $n$-dimensional
